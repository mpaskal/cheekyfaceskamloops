          Hello! I'm Sofya, a Kamloops local of 13 years, proud mom of two
          little girls, and passionate face painter. Inspired by my children's
          creativity and curiosity, I started this business to bring joy and
          imagination to families in our community. With over 5 years of
          experience working with kids and currently pursuing my Early Childhood
          Education certificate, I understand the importance of nurturing young
          minds and creating unforgettable experiences. My face painting
          services combine artistry, fun, and care, ensuring smiles and memories
          for children of all ages.

            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq5">
              We only use professional, high-end hypoallergenic products from
              reputable brands. Our paints are safe, non-toxic, and designed for
              use on skin. While allergic reactions are very rare, a small patch
              test can be done prior to a full design.

            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq6">
              While reactions are rare, wash the area gently with warm water and
              soap to remove the paint. If irritation persists, consult a
              healthcare professional. Please inform us of any known
              sensitivities beforehand so we can take precautions.

              How long does the face paint last?

            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq1">
              Our face paints are designed to last the entire event and can stay
              vibrant for several hours if left untouched. However, they can
              smudge if rubbed or exposed to excessive water.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq2">
              The face paint can be easily removed with mild soap and warm
              water. A soft washcloth or gentle makeup remover can help with any
              stubborn areas. No harsh scrubbing is required!

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq3">
              Our paints are water-based and will smudge if exposed to heavy
              rain or excessive moisture. For outdoor events, we recommend
              having a covered or shaded area to ensure everyone stays dry and
              comfortable.

            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer" id="faq4">
              Encourage kids to avoid rubbing their faces and stay away from
              water activities like swimming. For longer-lasting results, we
              recommend designs on arms or hands, which are less likely to
              smudge.
